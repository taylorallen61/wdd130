                                The drop off location is located behind the building in the florences chocolate parking lot. There is a large painted mural where you will find a doorbell stating “Ring for donations.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 It is preferred you donate during hours of operation or else you will have to leave your items outside until the store is opened the next day. If you ring anytime during the store hours, an assistant will collect your donations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 We accept any and all donations, but are most in need of food and clothing. Large items are difficult for us to fit in our store, so we recommend donating those items to Deseret Industries.
