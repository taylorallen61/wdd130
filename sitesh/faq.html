                        Not all members of the community get free items. If you are a victim of sexual assault, abuse or domestic violence, the family crises is here to help you. You are able to meet with our victim advocates who are able to give you resources to help you. One of those resources is providing you with any physical needs you may need which can be found in the thrift store.

On the left side of the mural you will see a doorbell that says “ring for donations” when you ring that doorbell you will be assisted and your donations will be collected. We appreciate all donations as they truly do help community members in need.

                        We accept all food and clothing items. Our food will be given away during our foodbank on Wednesdays and Fridays. We discourage donating large items such as bikes or furniture as our thrift store is small and there isnt too much room for those items.
